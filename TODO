Yo.

PermissionGroup should extend Table (so the same syntax is used), don't know
exactly how to do that yet.

Request should be sent as-is to U443::send() and should be directly translatable
to JSON

Possibly consider adding some less-generic functions to RequestFactory, for ease
of work.

Need to decide where responses are parsed.
Probable direction - Response object holds json response almost as-is. It will be able to return some information (errors,
etc.), but whoever asked for the data is in charge of parsing the data itself.
